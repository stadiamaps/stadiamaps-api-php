# Development Guide

## OpenAPI Code Generation

Much of the code in this project is generated by the OpenAPI generator.
Regenerating the generated portions of the codebase can be done simply with this command
(run this whenever new features / changes to the OpenAPI spec are released).

```shell
openapi-generator generate -i https://api.stadiamaps.com/openapi.yaml -g php --strict-spec=true -o . -p disallowAdditionalPropertiesIfNotPresent=false -p composerPackageName="stadiamaps/api" --global-property apiDocs=false,modelTests=false,modelDocs=false
```

## Tests

Integration tests require a Stadia Maps API key.
They are run automatically by CI.

```bash
export API_KEY=YOUR-API-KEY
composer install
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## Release

Create a GitHub release with an appropriate semantic version, and the rest is automatic!
